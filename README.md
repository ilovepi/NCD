Network Compression Detection

A Project for Comp 429 @ CSUN, to detect compression along a network transmission path.

The project will proceed in phases, and incrementally build to be an application suitable to an uncoperative environment.

We will use low and high entropy data sent along the network to detect if compression occurs. If a node compresses the data, the low entropy transmission times will differ significantly from the high entropy data transmission times, and give us a reliable way to detect compression.
